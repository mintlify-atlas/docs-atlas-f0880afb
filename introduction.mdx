## How it works

Mailman uses JSON files to define HTTP requests with variable placeholders. Variables are resolved from multiple sources in priority order:

1. Runtime `-v` arguments
2. `.env.<environment>` file
3. `.env` file
4. Request `defaultValues`
5. Environment variables from `config.json`

Unfilled variables prompt for interactive input before execution.

## Example request

Here's what a typical request file looks like:

```json requests/get-users.json
{
  "name": "Get Users",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
  }
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users.json
```

Or for production:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users.json -e prod
```

## Supported HTTP methods

Mailman supports all standard HTTP methods:

- `GET` - Retrieve resources
- `POST` - Create new resources
- `PUT` - Update entire resources
- `PATCH` - Partially update resources
- `DELETE` - Remove resources
