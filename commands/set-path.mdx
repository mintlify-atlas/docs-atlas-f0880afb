title: mailman set-path and show-path
description: Manage the default project path for Mailman commands
---

## Overview

Mailman provides two commands for managing a global default project path:

- `mailman set-path` - Set or clear the default project directory
- `mailman show-path` - Display the current default project path

These commands allow you to run Mailman commands from any directory without specifying the project path each time.

---

## mailman set-path

### Syntax

```bash
mailman set-path [path] [options]
```

### Description

The `set-path` command sets a default project directory for Mailman. Once set, you can run Mailman commands from any location on your system, and they will operate on the configured project.

This is useful when:
- You frequently switch between directories
- You want to run Mailman commands from anywhere
- You're working with a single main API project

### Arguments

<ParamField path="path" type="string" optional>
  Path to the Mailman project directory
  
  - Can be relative or absolute
  - If omitted, uses the current working directory
  - Must contain a valid `config.json` file
  
  Examples:
  - `./my-api-project`
  - `/home/user/projects/api`
  - `../another-project`
</ParamField>

### Options

<ParamField path="--clear" type="boolean">
  Clear the default project path
  
  Short flag: `-c`
  
  Removes the stored default path, returning to normal behavior where Mailman operates on the current directory
  
  Example: `--clear` or `-c`
</ParamField>

### Usage examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Set to current directory
mailman set-path
# Uses current directory
```

```bash Set to specific path
mailman set-path /home/user/my-api-project
mailman set-path ./projects/api
mailman set-path ~/work/backend-api
```

```bash Clear default path
mailman set-path --clear
mailman set-path -c
```

```bash Sample output - success
$ mailman set-path ~/projects/my-api

Default project path set to: /home/user/projects/my-api
```

```bash Sample output - no config found
$ mailman set-path ~/projects/invalid

No config.json found at /home/user/projects/invalid
Run 'mailman init' in that directory first.
```

```bash Sample output - cleared
$ mailman set-path --clear

Default project path cleared.
```

</CodeGroup>

### How it works

1. The command resolves the provided path to an absolute path
2. Validates that a `config.json` exists in that directory
3. Stores the path in a global configuration file
4. All subsequent Mailman commands use this path unless overridden

<Note>
The default path is stored globally on your system, so it persists across terminal sessions and directory changes.
</Note>

## mailman show-path

### Syntax

```bash
mailman show-path
```

### Description

The `show-path` command displays the currently configured default project path. Use this to verify which project Mailman will operate on when running commands from different directories.

### Usage examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Check default path
mailman show-path
```

```bash Sample output - path is set
$ mailman show-path

Default project path: /home/user/projects/my-api
```

```bash Sample output - no path set
$ mailman show-path

No default project path set.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common use cases

### Single project workflow

Set a default path for your main API project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/my-api

# Initialize if needed
mailman init

# Set as default
mailman set-path

# Now you can run commands from anywhere
cd ~/Documents
mailman list
mailman run requests/get-users.json

# Still works
cd /tmp
mailman view requests/create-user.json
```

### Switching between projects

```bash
# Set default to project A
mailman set-path ~/projects/api-a
mailman show-path
# Default project path: /home/user/projects/api-a

# Work with project A
mailman list
mailman run requests/test.json

# Switch to project B
mailman set-path ~/projects/api-b
mailman show-path
# Default project path: /home/user/projects/api-b

# Now working with project B
mailman list
mailman run requests/test.json
```

### Team collaboration

Set up a shared project path for team members:

```bash
# Each team member sets their local path
mailman set-path ~/shared/team-api

# Everyone can now run commands from anywhere
mailman list
mailman run requests/smoke-tests.json
```

### CI/CD integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline

# Set the project path
mailman set-path /workspace/api-tests

# Run tests from any directory
mailman run requests/health-check.json
mailman run requests/integration-test.json

# Clear when done
mailman set-path --clear
```

### Temporary override

Even with a default path set, you can work on a different project by running commands from within that project's directory:

```bash
# Default is set to project A
mailman set-path ~/projects/api-a

# But you can still work on project B by being in its directory
cd ~/projects/api-b
mailman list  # Lists requests from api-b, not api-a
mailman run requests/test.json  # Runs from api-b
```

<Warning>
This behavior depends on implementation. Check your version's behavior to confirm.
</Warning>

### Multiple environments workflow

```bash
# Development project
mailman set-path ~/dev/api
mailman run requests/test.json --env dev

# Switch to staging project (separate config)
mailman set-path ~/staging/api  
mailman run requests/test.json --env staging

# Clear and work locally
mailman set-path --clear
cd ~/current-project
mailman run requests/test.json
```

## Verification workflow

Before running important commands, verify your current default path:

```bash
# Check which project is active
mailman show-path

# If it's wrong, set the correct one
mailman set-path ~/correct/project

# Verify again
mailman show-path

# Now safe to run commands
mailman run requests/important-request.json --env prod
```

## Best practices

### For individual developers

- Set a default path if you primarily work on one API project
- Use `show-path` regularly to confirm which project is active
- Clear the default path when switching to project-specific work

### For teams

- Document the expected project structure in your team's README
- Include `mailman set-path` instructions in onboarding docs
- Use relative paths in documentation (e.g., `requests/test.json` instead of absolute paths)

### For automation

- Always set the path explicitly in scripts
- Clear the path at the end of scripts to avoid side effects
- Use absolute paths in CI/CD to avoid ambiguity

<Tip>
Use `mailman show-path` before running critical production commands to ensure you're operating on the correct project.
</Tip>

<Note>
The default project path is stored in a global configuration file on your system, separate from any project-specific `config.json` files.
