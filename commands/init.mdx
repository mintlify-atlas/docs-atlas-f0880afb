description: Initialize a new Mailman project with sample configuration and request files
---

## Syntax

```bash
mailman init
```

## Description

The `mailman init` command sets up a new Mailman project in your current directory. It creates a configuration file with environment definitions and a requests directory with sample HTTP request files to help you get started quickly.

This command is typically the first command you run when setting up Mailman in a new project.

## What it creates

When you run `mailman init`, the following files and directories are created:

1. **config.json** - Project configuration with environment definitions
2. **requests/** - Directory for storing request files
3. **requests/get-users.json** - Sample GET request
4. **requests/create-user.json** - Sample POST request

<Note>
If any of these files already exist, `mailman init` will skip them and preserve your existing configuration.
</Note>

## Generated configuration

The `config.json` file created includes two environments:

```json
{
  "defaultEnvironment": "dev",
  "environments": {
    "dev": {
      "variables": {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
        "exampleVariable": "dev-example-variable"
      }
    },
    "prod": {
      "variables": {
        "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
        "exampleVariable": "prod-example-variable"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sample requests

Two sample request files are generated to demonstrate different HTTP methods:

<CodeGroup>

```json requests/get-users.json
{
  "name": "Get Users",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
  }
}
```

```json requests/create-user.json
{
  "name": "Create User",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Basic initialization
mailman init
```

```bash Output
Created config.json
Created requests/ directory
Created requests/get-users.json
Created requests/create-user.json

Mailman initialized successfully!
Run 'mailman list' to see available requests
```

```bash Already initialized
# If files already exist
mailman init

# Output:
config.json already exists, skipping...
get-users.json already exists, skipping...
create-user.json already exists, skipping...
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common use cases

### Starting a new project

```bash
# Create a new directory for your API requests
mkdir my-api-project
cd my-api-project

# Initialize Mailman
mailman init

# View the sample requests
mailman list
```

### Converting from Postman

If you're migrating from Postman, initialize Mailman in your project directory and then replace the sample requests with your own:

```bash
# Initialize the structure
mailman init

# Remove sample files and add your own
rm requests/*.json
# Create your requests using mailman new or manually
mailman new
```

<Tip>
After running `mailman init`, use `mailman list` to verify your project was set up correctly.
