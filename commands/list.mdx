title: mailman list
description: List all available HTTP request files in your Mailman project
---

## Syntax

```bash
mailman list
```

## Description

The `mailman list` command displays all available HTTP request files in your Mailman project's `requests/` directory. It recursively scans all subdirectories and shows the request name along with its file path.

This command helps you quickly see what requests are available to run or view without manually exploring the file system.

## Requirements

- A valid `config.json` file must exist in your project directory
- The `requests/` directory should contain `.json` request files

<Warning>
If no `config.json` is found, you'll see an error message: "No config.json found. Run 'mailman init' first."
</Warning>

## Output format

For each request found, the command displays:

1. **Request name** (in green) - The `name` field from the request file
2. **File path** (in gray) - Relative path from the project root

## Usage examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash Basic usage
mailman list
```

```bash Sample output
Available requests:

  Get Users
  requests/get-users.json

  Create User
  requests/create-user.json

  Update User
  requests/users/update-user.json

  Delete User
  requests/users/delete-user.json
```

```bash No requests found
mailman list

# Output:
No requests found in requests/ directory.
```

```bash Not initialized
mailman list

# Output:
No config.json found. Run 'mailman init' first.
```

</CodeGroup>

## How it works

The `mailman list` command:

1. Loads your `config.json` to verify the project is initialized
2. Recursively scans the `requests/` directory for `.json` files
3. Parses each JSON file to extract the request name
4. Displays the name and relative path for each valid request
5. Skips any invalid JSON files or files that don't match the request schema

<Note>
Only files with a `.json` extension are scanned. The command automatically skips any files that don't have valid request structure.
</Note>

## Common use cases

### Discovering available requests

When working in a team project or unfamiliar codebase:

```bash
cd project-directory
mailman list
```

### Verifying request organization

Check that your requests are properly organized in subdirectories:

```bash
# List all requests to see the directory structure
mailman list

# Example output shows organization:
# requests/auth/login.json
# requests/auth/logout.json
# requests/users/list-users.json
# requests/users/create-user.json
```

### Before running requests

Confirm the exact file path before using `mailman run` or `mailman view`:

```bash
# List to find the path
mailman list

# Then use the exact path shown
mailman run requests/users/get-user.json
```

## Subdirectory support

The command recursively scans subdirectories within `requests/`, allowing you to organize your requests by feature, service, or any structure that makes sense for your project:

```
requests/
├── auth/
│   ├── login.json
│   └── logout.json
├── users/
│   ├── create.json
│   ├── list.json
│   └── update.json
└── posts/
    ├── create.json
    └── list.json
```

<Tip>
Organize your requests into subdirectories by feature or API endpoint for better project structure. The `mailman list` command will show them all with their full paths.
