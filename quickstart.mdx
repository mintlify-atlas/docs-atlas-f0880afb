description: Get started with Mailman in minutes by making your first HTTP request
---

# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through setting up a Mailman project and executing your first HTTP request in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have [installed Mailman](/installation).

## Create your first project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize a new project">
    Create a new directory for your project and initialize Mailman:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-api-project
    cd my-api-project
    mailman init
    ```

    This command creates:
    - `config.json` - Configuration file with environment settings
    - `requests/` - Directory for your request files
    - `requests/get-users.json` - Sample GET request
    - `requests/create-user.json` - Sample POST request

    <Info>
    If you already have a `config.json` or sample requests, Mailman will skip them to avoid overwriting your existing files.
    </Info>

    You should see output like:

    ```
    Created config.json
    Created requests/ directory
    Created requests/get-users.json
    Created requests/create-user.json

    Mailman initialized successfully!
    Run 'mailman list' to see available requests
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the configuration">
    Let's look at the generated `config.json`:

    ```json config.json
    {
      "defaultEnvironment": "dev",
      "environments": {
        "dev": {
          "variables": {
            "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
            "exampleVariable": "dev-example-variable"
          }
        },
        "prod": {
          "variables": {
            "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
            "exampleVariable": "prod-example-variable"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This defines two environments (`dev` and `prod`) with different `baseUrl` values. Variables can be referenced in requests using `{{variableName}}` syntax.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Examine a sample request">
    Check out the GET request that was created:

    ```json requests/get-users.json
    {
      "name": "Get Users",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
      }
    }
    ```

    This request uses two variables:
    - `{{baseUrl}}` - Will resolve to `http://localhost:3000` in dev environment
    - `{{API_KEY}}` - Will prompt for input since it's not defined anywhere
  </Step>

  <Step title="List available requests">
    View all requests in your project:

    ```bash
    mailman list
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Available requests:

      Get Users
      requests/get-users.json

      Create User
      requests/create-user.json
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview a request">
    Before running a request, you can preview how variables will be resolved:

    ```bash
    mailman view requests/get-users.json
    ```

    This shows the fully resolved request with all variables replaced. You'll be prompted to enter any unfilled variables (like `{{API_KEY}}`).

    <Tip>
    Use `mailman view` to debug variable resolution issues before actually sending requests.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first request">
    Execute the GET request:

    ```bash
    mailman run requests/get-users.json
    ```

    Since `{{API_KEY}}` isn't defined, Mailman will prompt you:

    ```
    ✔ API_KEY … your-api-key-here
    ```

    After entering the value, the request executes and displays:

    ```
    Running: Get Users
    Environment: dev
    GET http://localhost:3000/users

    Status: 200 OK
    Time: 145ms

    Response Headers:
      content-type: application/json
      content-length: 256

    Response Body:
    {
      "users": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "email": "alice@example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    If the server isn't running, you'll see a "Connection refused" error. That's expected for this tutorial - the sample request points to `localhost:3000`.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use environment files

Instead of entering `{{API_KEY}}` every time, store it in an environment file.

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash .env
API_KEY=sk_test_abc123xyz789
DEBUG=true
```

Now when you run the request, `{{API_KEY}}` will be automatically resolved from the `.env` file:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users.json
```

<Tip>
Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to keep secrets out of version control:

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo ".env.*" >> .gitignore
```
</Tip>

## Switch environments

Run the same request in production:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users.json -e prod
```

This uses the `prod` environment from `config.json`, so `{{baseUrl}}` resolves to `https://api.example.com` instead of `http://localhost:3000`.

You can also create environment-specific files:

```bash .env.prod
API_KEY=sk_live_realproductionkey
```

## Override variables at runtime

Override any variable without modifying files:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users.json -v API_KEY=temporary-key -v baseUrl=https://staging.example.com
```

The `-v` flag has the highest priority and overrides all other variable sources.

## Interactive mode

Run `mailman run` without a filepath to select from all available requests:

```bash
mailman run
```

You'll see an interactive menu:

```
? Select a request to run
  Run new request
❯ Get Users - requests/get-users.json
  Create User - requests/create-user.json
```

Use arrow keys to select and press Enter. You can even create and run a new request on the fly by selecting "Run new request".

## Create a new request

Add a POST request to create a user:

```bash
mailman new
```

Mailman will prompt you to:
1. Select a directory (or create a new one)
2. Enter request details interactively
3. Provide a filename

Alternatively, create the file manually:

```json requests/update-user.json
{
  "name": "Update User",
  "method": "PATCH",
  "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users/{{userId}}",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
mailman run requests/update-user.json -v userId=123
```

## Variable resolution priority

When the same variable is defined in multiple places, Mailman uses this priority order (highest first):

1. **Runtime `-v` arguments** - Highest priority
2. **`.env.<environment>` file** - Environment-specific variables
3. **`.env` file** - Shared variables
4. **Request `defaultValues`** - Per-request defaults
5. **Environment variables from `config.json`** - Lowest priority

Example with `defaultValues` in a request:

```json requests/get-users-paginated.json
{
  "name": "Get Users (Paginated)",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users?limit={{limit}}&offset={{offset}}",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_KEY}}"
  },
  "defaultValues": {
    "limit": "10",
    "offset": "0"
  }
}
```

Run with defaults:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users-paginated.json
```

Or override at runtime:

```bash
mailman run requests/get-users-paginated.json -v limit=50 -v offset=100
```
